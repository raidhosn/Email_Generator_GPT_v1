# Email Generator UI

Static clone of the "Email Generator AI" interface with a lightweight Node server for local preview.

## Running locally
1. Ensure Node.js is installed.
2. From the project directory, start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Optionally choose a different port or host:
   ```bash
   PORT=8001 HOST=0.0.0.0 npm start
   ```
3. Open the URL printed in the console (default: http://localhost:8000).

If the page does not load, verify no other process is using the chosen port. Any startup errors will now be printed to the console.
